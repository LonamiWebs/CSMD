CSMD
====

A simple and quick CSharp command prompt for Windows


About
-----

**CSMD** is a C# designed application that emulates the Windows command prompt, and allows you to quickly type in some C# sharp code, compile it, and run it!

You can even write your own CSMD scripts (*.cst files*) and open these as if it were executable files, with the difference that you can open them up in Notepad, edit them, save them, and then run again!

Current features
----------------

The current features available in the 1.4.0.0 version for CSMD are:
 * Compile C# code from the CSMD console
 * Save code snippets anywhere and execute these in any computer with CSMD
 * Change the .Net framework target version
 * Decide whether create a temporal executable file or not
 * Add references to external libraries
 * C# autocompletion. It will always suggest all declared variables and methods, and it shows the current method information (if it's not declared by you)
